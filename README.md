# Python Mastery: From Syntax to Algorithms

This repository is a complete learning path for Python, covering everything from basic syntax to advanced Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), file manipulation, and algorithmic logic.

## 📚 Curriculum Overview
The course is divided into three main pillars:

### 1. Python Tutorial (The Essentials)
Master the core syntax and built-in features of the language:
* **Basics:** Variables, Data Types, Casting, and Operators.
* **Data Structures:** Lists, Tuples, Sets, and Dictionaries.
* **Logic & Control:** If...Else, Match, While/For Loops, and Functions.
* **Advanced Tools:** RegEx, JSON, Pip, Try...Except, and Virtual Environments.
* **Formatting:** In-depth coverage of String Formatting and User Input.

### 2. Python Classes & OOP
Learn to write scalable, modular code using Object-Oriented Programming:
* **Foundations:** Classes/Objects, the `__init__` method, and the `self` parameter.
* **Methods & Properties:** Class methods and property management.
* **Advanced OOP:** Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, and Inner Classes.

### 3. File Handling
Understand how to interact with the computer's file system:
* Reading files and extracting data.
* Writing, creating, and updating files.
* Safe file deletion and management.
